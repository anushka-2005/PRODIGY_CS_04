Creating a keylogger program involves capturing keystrokes and saving them to a file. Keyloggers can be used for malicious purposes, so it's important to stress that they should only be used for ethical purposes, such as personal use on your own devices or for authorized monitoring. Always obtain explicit permission from any user whose keystrokes will be logged.
